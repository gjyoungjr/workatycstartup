We\u2019re using AI agents to automate the manual work of compliance officers in banks and fintechs \u2013 an area where financial institutions spend $30B annually. Our AI agents have already reduced manual reviews by 87% in some cases, all at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n<p>Our vision is to build the future of compliance in financial services. We\u2019re using AI agents to turn compliance into just another back-office automation. While doing so, we\u2019re building the largest risk network ever \u2013 and setting the stage to solve an even bigger problem: identity.

    "full_text": "TL;DR: Build generalised computer-use and a knowledge graph of all the bad people in the world using Python, LLMs, VLMs and traditional ML.\nNote: we\u2019re in-person in SF. We\u2019re flexible on where you work initially and happy to provide all the support you need for the move.\nAbout Us\nSphinx is a well-funded YC startup from the F24 batch. We\u2019re using AI agents to automate the manual work of compliance officers in banks and fintechs \u2013 an area where financial institutions spend $30B annually. Our AI agents have already reduced manual reviews by 87% in some cases, all at a fraction of the cost.\nOur vision is to build the future of compliance in financial services. We\u2019re using AI agents to turn compliance into just another back-office automation. While doing so, we\u2019re building the largest risk network ever \u2013 and setting the stage to solve an even bigger problem: identity. But more on that later.\nThe Team\nAlex (a.k.a. Mr. CEO): Built a system saving Amazon $12M a year as an 18-year-old intern and conducted AI research on LLM hallucinations at MIT. He\u2019ll sell ice cubes to eskimos if he needs to.\nChris (Whiteboard Dude): First employee and Head of Engineering at RelyComply, where he scaled the company from $0 to $12M ARR. Before that, he was a professional DOTA player.\nTogether, we founded and exited Adorno AI, an audio generation startup, before starting Sphinx.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking For\nWe\u2019re looking for Sphinx\u2019s first founding engineer. You\u2019ll have front-row seats to a scrappy, driven team taking on an industry that hasn\u2019t evolved since fax machines.\nAs employee #1, you\u2019ll work directly with us (the founders) from day one to shape the future of the company. You\u2019ll make key technical decisions, build the product, and help assemble a team of A-players.\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for:\n- No ego: Company > team > self.\n- Love working hard: This isn\u2019t a \u201cchill\u201d job \u2013 it will be intense, demanding, and incredibly rewarding.\n- Speedy coder: You love complex problems and designing the simplest solution for them. Bonus if you understand that having zero technical debt is infeasible for a startup and have experience in choosing where that technical debt should be loaned from.\n- Client-Driven: We don\u2019t code in the dark. Everything we build is 100% based on client need \u2013 we\u2019re here to build something people want.\n- Ownership: You don\u2019t wait for permission \u2013 you see problems, solve them, and own the outcome.\nIf this sounds like you, let\u2019s build something great together.\nResponsibilities\nThere are two big endeavors Sphinx is working on:\n1. A Generalizable Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Agent\n\nOperating in an industry where mistakes cost a minimum of $250k.\nThink Claude Computer Use, but better.\n\n2. A Knowledge Graph of All the Bad People in the World\n\nLeveraging LLMs, graph databases, and website-agnostic scraping.\nBuilt to handle millions of pages per day at scale.\n\nYou\u2019ll be taking the lead on one of these projects, building ML systems from notebook to AWS \u2013 essentially the fun part of our current CTO\u2019s work. Tech we\u2019re using to in these projects: Python, LLMs, VLMs, traditional ML, Django, Docker, Postgres, AWS"

We are looking for teammates who are motivated to build for a world where receiving high quality medical care is as frictionless as Shopify\u2019s checkout.\nRole:\nYou will be a product engineer, owning entire features across the stack.\nYou will be one of the first hires and report to the CTO.\nWe are supply constrained; your work will unlock our pipeline worth $millions in revenue.\nWhat we look for:\nYou love building and being around builders.\nYou seek (and help foster) energizing work environments, with a preference to work hard, in our NYC office, five days a week.\nYou strive (key word) to produce zero defect work for our customers.\nYou are honest.\nYou are kind.\nYou are low ego and don\u2019t make excuses.\nOur values:\nWe are customer obsessed.\nWe take responsibility for our work. Things will go wrong, there is no time to play the blame game.\nOur machines learn, and so do our humans. We grow from our mistakes.\nWe enjoy each other\u2019s company.\nThe process:\n\n15-minute chat with Tej (CEO)\n45-minute \u201ctechnical\u201d resume deep-dive and a schema design exercise with Aumesh (CTO)\nA take-home\n1-hour take-home review & coding challenge\nWork trial (paid)\n\nBenefits:\n\nCompetitive health, dental, and vision plans are fully paid for by the company\nGuideline 401K\nDaily in-office lunch\nNice gym in-office\n\nTech stack:\nWe choose our stack to optimize for performance and iteration speed as we grow. We use React, Typescript, Node.js, Tailwind, and Docker. Our database is PostgreSQL. We experiment with all of the cutting edge LLMs and use most in production for different use cases.\nYou do not have to have worked with this stack before.\nFounders:\nTej (CEO) and Aumesh (CTO) have been good friends since college and are both technical.\nAumesh was an engineer at Microsoft before joining Compound (S19) as one of their first engineers, helping their platform scale to over $2B AUM.\nTej grew revenues 10x at Fair Square (W20) as their head of growth, and helped the company raise their Series A + achieve profitability. He flipped houses to pay for college."
